App Feature Summary 
Assignment(Weather App) 
This is the app I created in React Native, and it is the second time I have worked with this 
framework. 
The features of the app include: 
• Displaying the weather at the current location. 
• Showing a 5-day weather forecast for the current location. 
• Allowing users to search for other locations and view their weather details. 
Learnings 
While building this app, I learned: 
• How to use React Hooks such as useRef and useEffect. 
• How to fetch data without using a backend, by relying only on hooks. 
• Improved my styling abilities in React Native. 
• How to use platform-specific code to make the app compatible with both Android 
and iOS. 
• How to enable geolocation to get the user’s current location. 
• How async functions work and how they help in making the app more efficient. 
Challenges 
The major challenge I faced was: 
• List rendering using FlatList, which required careful handling to make the data display 
efficiently. 
• The other challenge which I faced during searching is that the number of character 
which trigger the api call. First I think why putting  a character limit. But later I don’t 
want my app to do unnecessary api calls . so I put character limit above two.(thanks 
to stackoverflow and other platforms) 
• My code is working very slow. So I learnt about async () function which help my code 
to fetch data without freezing my app
